# 3D Social Media Icons

## Overview
This HTML/CSS project creates a set of 3D social media icons with hover effects. The icons are styled to appear as 3D boxes that transform when hovered over.

## Key Features

### HTML Structure
- Uses Font Awesome icons for social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Instagram)
- Simple unordered list (`<ul>`) with list items (`<li>`) for each icon
- Each icon is wrapped in an anchor tag (`<a>`) for clickability

### CSS Styling
1. **Base Styling**:
   - Centers the entire component in the viewport using absolute positioning and transform
   - Sets up a flex container for horizontal icon arrangement

2. **3D Effect Creation**:
   - Uses `transform: rotate() skew()` to create the 3D perspective
   - Implements pseudo-elements (`:before` and `:after`) to create the side and bottom of the 3D box
   - Adds box-shadow for depth

3. **Hover Effects**:
   - Icons move up and to the right on hover (`transform: skew() translate()`)
   - Box-shadow intensifies for more dramatic effect
   - Icon color changes to white
   - Each social media platform has its own distinct background color:
     - Facebook: Blue (#3b5998)
     - Twitter: Light Blue (#00aced)
     - Google+: Red (#dd4b39)
     - Instagram: Pink (#e4405f)

### Technical Details
- Uses Font Awesome via CDN for the icons
- Relies heavily on CSS transforms for the 3D effect
- Uses pseudo-elements to create the 3D box sides
- Transition effects make the hover animations smooth

## Improvements/Considerations
1. **Accessibility**:
   - Add `aria-label` to links for screen readers
   - Consider adding focus states for keyboard navigation

2. **Responsiveness**:
   - The current fixed positioning might not work well on all screen sizes
   - Could add media queries for smaller screens

3. **Modernization**:
   - Google+ is deprecated - could replace with another platform
   - Could use CSS variables for the color schemes

4. **Performance**:
   - The heavy use of transforms and shadows is performant, but worth testing on older devices
